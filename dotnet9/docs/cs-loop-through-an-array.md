# C# Loop Through Arrays

You can loop through the array elements with the `for` loop, and use the `Length` property to specify how many times the loop should run.

The following example outputs all elements in the **cars** array:

**Example:**

```cs
string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (int i = 0; i < cars.Length; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(cars[i]);
}
```

## The foreach Loop

There is also a `foreach` loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an **array**:

**Syntax:**

```cs
foreach (type variableName in arrayName)
{
  // code block to be executed
}
```

The following example outputs all elements in the cars array, using a `foreach` loop:

**Example:**

```cs
string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
foreach (string i in cars)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

The example above can be read like this: **for each** `string` element (called **i** - as in index) in **cars**, print out the value of **i**.

If you compare the `for` loop and `foreach` loop, you will see that the `foreach` method is easier to write, it does not require a counter (using the `Length` property), and it is more readable.
