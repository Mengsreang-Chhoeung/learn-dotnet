# C# While Loop

## Loops

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

## C# While Loop

The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`:

**Syntax:**

```cs
while (condition)
{
  // code block to be executed
}
```

In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:

**Example:**

```cs
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
```

> **Note:** Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

## The Do/While Loop

The `do/while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```cs
do
{
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```

The example below uses a `do/while` loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

**Example:**

```cs
int i = 0;
do
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
```

> Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!
