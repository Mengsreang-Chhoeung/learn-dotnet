# C# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the **assignment** operator (`=`) to assign the value 10 to a variable called **x**:

**Example:**

```cs
int x = 10;
```

The **addition assignment** operator (`+=`) adds a value to a variable:

**Example:**

```cs
int x = 10;
x += 5;
```

A list of all assignment operators:

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| =        | x = 5   | x = 5      |
| +=       | x += 3  | x = x + 3  |
| -=       | x -= 3  | x = x - 3  |
| \*=      | x \*= 3 | x = x \* 3 |
| /=       | x /= 3  | x = x / 3  |
| %=       | x %= 3  | x = x % 3  |
| &=       | x &= 3  | x = x & 3  |
| \|=      | x \|= 3 | x = x \| 3 |
| ^=       | x ^= 3  | x = x ^ 3  |
| >>=      | x >>= 3 | x = x >> 3 |
| <<=      | x <<= 3 | x = x << 3 |
