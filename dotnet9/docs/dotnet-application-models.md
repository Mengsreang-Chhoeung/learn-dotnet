# .NET's Application Models

You can build many types of apps with **.NET**. To help you build apps faster, app models are built on top of the base libraries.

- **Web:** Build web apps and services for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.
- **Mobile:** Use a single codebase to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and more.
- **Desktop:** Create native apps for Windows and macOS or build apps that run anywhere with web technologies.
- **Artificial Intelligence and ML:** Build smart apps with C#, OpenAI, and Azure.
- **Cloud:** Consume existing cloud services, or create and deploy your own.
- **Microservices:** Create independently deployable microservices that run on Docker containers.
- **Game development:** Develop 2D and 3D games for the most popular desktops, phones, and consoles.
- **Internet of Things:** Make IoT apps, with native support for the Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers.
