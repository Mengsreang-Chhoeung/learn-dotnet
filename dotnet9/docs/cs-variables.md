# C# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- **int -** stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.
- **double -** stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.
- **char -** stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.
- **string -** stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes.
- **bool -** stores values with two states: true or false.

## Declaring (Creating) Variables

To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:

**Syntax:**

```
type variableName = value;
```

Where _type_ is a C# type (such as `int` or `string`), and _variableName_ is the name of the variable (such as **x** or **name**). The **equal sign** is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:

**Example:**

Create a variable called **name** of type `string` and assign it the value **"John"**:

```cs
string name = "John";
Console.WriteLine(name);
```

To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:

**Example:**

Create a variable called **myNum** of type `int` and assign it the value **15**:

```cs
int myNum = 15;
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
```

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

**Example:**

```cs
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
```

Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

**Example:**

Change the value of `myNum` to 20:

```cs
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20; // myNum is now 20
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
```

## Other Types

A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types:

**Example:**

```cs
int myNum = 5;
double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;
char myLetter = 'D';
bool myBool = true;
string myText = "Hello";
```
