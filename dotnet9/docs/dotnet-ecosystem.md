# .NET Ecosystem

There are multiple variants of **.NET**, each supporting a different type of app. The reason for multiple variants is part historical, part technical.

**.NET** implementations:

- **.NET Framework --** The original .NET. It provides access to the broad capabilities of Windows and Windows Server. It is actively supported, in maintenance.
- **Mono --** The original community and open source .NET. A cross-platform implementation of .NET Framework. Actively supported for Android, iOS, and WebAssembly.
- **.NET (Core) --** Modern .NET. A cross-platform and open source implementation of .NET, rethought for the cloud age while remaining significantly compatible with .NET Framework. Actively supported for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
