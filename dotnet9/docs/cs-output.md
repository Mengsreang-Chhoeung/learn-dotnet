# C# Output

To output values or print text in C#, you can use the `WriteLine()` method:

**Example:**

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

You can add as many `WriteLine()` methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:

**Example:**

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");
```

You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:

**Example:**

```cs
Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);
```

## The Write Method

There is also a `Write()` method, which is similar to `WriteLine()`.

The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

**Example:**

```cs
Console.Write("Hello World! ");
Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");
```

Note that we add an extra space when needed (after "Hello World!" in the example above), for better readability.
